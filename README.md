# Sonic Marathon - The Website History

Hi! This is a history of some websites I developed for **Sonic Marathon**, a 7-day stream of [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog) games, all to help out [Special Effect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/), a charity dedicated to help people with disabilities enjoy video games in accessible ways.


# What's included?

This repository includes websites for the following editions:

 - Sonic Marathon 5
 - Sonic Marathon 6

These were both made in two different frameworks, namely [**Bootstrap**](getbootstrap.com) and [**Materialize**](materializecss.com), useful for mobile responsiveness.

The SM6 folder uses an earlier version of a dynamic Twitch embed built for my [portfolio website](https://gitlab.com/pnboliveira/portfolioweb/blob/master/js/init.js), which also uses the Twitch API.
